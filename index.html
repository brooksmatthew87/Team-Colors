    <h1>Team Color Differences</h1>
    <p>Christen Bromberg once implied that all my favorite teams shared colors are the same. I will provide direct evidence here to show the differences between all 10 of my favorite sports teams colors.</p>
    <p>I will admit that there are a lot of shared colors among the teams I follow, even more so than I realized. 7 out of the 10 teams have a shade of blue as a primary color, and 5 out of 10 have a shade of red. However, I cannot stand by and let Christen imply that "they are all the same color of blue" or any other such slander. </p>
    <p>Below, I will compare each color among my teams side by side so the differences will be much clearer to the casual observer (Christen Bromberg).</p>  
    
    <h2>First up, the Blues!</h2>
    <p>Buffalo Bills: "Blue"</p>
    <p>Detroit Lions: "Honolulu Blue"</p>
    <p>New York Giants: "Dark Blue"</p>
    <p>Atlanta Braves: "Navy"</p>
    <p>Kansas City Royals: "Royal Blue"</p>
    <p>Los Angeles Angels: "Midnight Blue</p>
    <p>Toronto Blue Jays: "Blue"</p>
    <p>Toronto Blue Jays: "Navy Blue"</p>
    <p>You will no doubt notice that the Blue Jays have two shades of blue in their color scheme, which is fitting. </p>
    
    <h2>Next, we have the Reds!</h2>
    <p>Buffalo Bills: "Red"</p>
    <p>New York Giants: "Red"</p>
    <p>Atlanta Braves: "Scarlet"</p>
    <p>Los Angeles Angels: "Red"</p>
    <p>Los Angeles Angels: "Maroon"</p>
    <p>Toronto Blue Jays: "Red"</p>
    <p>Here, the Angels are the team with double shades of one color. But I would rather draw attention to the Braves here, with their fancy use of "Scarlett"</p>
