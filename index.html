    <h1>Team Color Differences</h1>
    <p>Christen Bromberg once implied that all my favorite teams' shared colors are the same. I will provide direct evidence here to show the differences between all 10 of my favorite sports teams' colors.</p>
    <p>I will admit that there are a lot of shared colors among the teams I follow, even more so than I realized. 7 out of the 10 teams have a shade of blue as a primary color, and 5 out of 10 have a shade of red. However, I cannot stand by and let Christen imply that "they are all the same color of blue" or any other such slander. </p>
    <p>Below, I will compare each color among my teams side by side so the differences will be much clearer to the casual observer (Christen Bromberg).</p>  
    
    <h2>First up, the Blues!</h2>
    <p class="billsblue">Buffalo Bills: "Blue"</p>
    <p class="lionsblue">Detroit Lions: "Honolulu Blue"</p>
    <p class="giantsblue">New York Giants: "Dark Blue"</p>
    <p class="bravesblue">Atlanta Braves: "Navy"</p>
    <p class="royalsblue">Kansas City Royals: "Royal Blue"</p>
    <p class="angelsblue">Los Angeles Angels: "Midnight Blue</p>
    <p class="jaysblue">Toronto Blue Jays: "Blue"</p>
    <p class="jaysblue2">Toronto Blue Jays: "Navy Blue"</p>
    <p>You will no doubt notice that the Blue Jays have two shades of blue in their color scheme, which is fitting. </p>
    
    <h2>Next, we have the Reds!</h2>
    <p class="billsred">Buffalo Bills: "Red"</p>
    <p class="giantsred">New York Giants: "Red"</p>
    <p class="bravesred">Atlanta Braves: "Scarlet"</p>
    <p class="angelsred">Los Angeles Angels: "Red"</p>
    <p class="angelsred2">Los Angeles Angels: "Maroon"</p>
    <p class="jaysred">Toronto Blue Jays: "Red"</p>
    <p>Here, the Angels are the team with double shades of one color. But I would rather draw attention to the Braves, with their fancy use of "Scarlett"</p>

    <h2>Now, the Blacks!</h2>
    <p>Am I allowed to say that?</p>
    <p class="saintsblack">New Orleans Saints: "Black"</p>
    <p class="raidersblack">Las Vegas Raiders: "Raiders Black"</p>
    <p class="soxblack">Chicago White Sox: "Black"</p>
    <p>I mean, come on, Christen! My teams don't even use the same shade of black! Look at that diversity of color!</p>
    
    <h2>The Silver lining!</h2>
    <p class="raiderssilver">Las Vegas Raiders: "Raiders Silver"</p>
    <p class="soxsilver">Chicago White Sox: "Silver"</p>
    <p class="angelssilver">Los Angeles Angels: "Silver"</p>
    <p class="lionssilver">Detroit Lions: "Silver"</p>
    <p>Well, here I have to eat some humble pie. I didn't even know this until now, but the Silver in the White Sox and the Angels are actually the exact same code color. How embarrassing.</p>
    
    <h2>Finally, we strike Gold!</h2>
    <p class="saintsgold">New Orleans Saints: "Old Gold"</p>
    <p class="royalsgold">Kansas City Royals: "Gold"</p>
    <p class="bravesgold">Atlanta Braves: "Gold"</p>
    <p>I am not buying that the Braves have a gold color, but that is the official name for their yellow color. Honestly, the Braves are dripping with southern fanciness. Scarlet, Navy and Gold? Stonewall Jackson will ride again. </p>

    <h2>In conclusion.</h2>
    <p>Now I would argue that no one, in good faith, could ever say my teams are all the same color. Thank you, and good night. </p>
